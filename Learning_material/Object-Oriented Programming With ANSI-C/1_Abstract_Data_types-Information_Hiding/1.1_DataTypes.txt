Typically we would define an element of a linear list as a structure

typedef struct node {
	struct node *next;
	... information ...
}node;

and for the opearations we specify function headers like
		node *head (node *elt, const node * tail);

==> This approach, however, is quite sloppy. Good programming principles dictat that
we conceal the representation of a data item and declare only the possible manipulations
