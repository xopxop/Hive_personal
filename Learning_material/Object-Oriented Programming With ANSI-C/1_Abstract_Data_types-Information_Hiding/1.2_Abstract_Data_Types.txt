We call a data type [abstract] if we do not reveal its representation to the user
At a theoretical level this requires us to specify the properties of the data typeby mathematical
axioms involving the possible operations. For example:
	we can remove an element from a queue only as often as we added one previously
	and we retrieve the elements in the same order in which they were added

Abstract data type offer GREAT FLEXIBILITY to the programmer
Abstract data types satisfy the good programming principles of information hiding and divide and conquer
